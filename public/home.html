        ARs deal with architecture documentation and the architecture’s manifestation in the code and run-time artifacts. A single architectural syntax tree doesn’t exist. ARs pertain to components and connectors (modeled, sketched, or represented implicitly in code), design decision logs (in structured or unstructured text), and planning artifacts such as work items in project management tools.
        ARs address architectural smells, which are suspicions or indications that something in the architecture is no longer adequate under the current requirements and constraints, which might differ from the original ones. An AR, then, is a coordinated set of deliberate architectural activities that remove a particular architectural smell and improve at least one quality attribute without changing the system’s scope and functionality. An AR might negatively influence other quality attributes, owing to conflicting requirements and tradeoffs.
