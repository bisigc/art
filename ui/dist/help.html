<h2>What is Architectural Refactoring?</h2>
<p>An Architectural Refactoring is a guideline to implement a quality improving measure in a software system. 
    Based on symptoms (Smells), someone will try to find the cause of the deterioration in the system and a suitable improvement.
    An Architectural Refactoring is not an entirely self explaining guidance for the realisation, but it contains a summary
    of the change and a list of the most relevant execution tasks as well as several references. The following table describes the 
    structure of an Architectural Refactoring.

                    The references are an important part of the Architectural Refactorings. Since an Architectural Refactoring does not contain an exhaustive description of the refactoring it is necessary to have guidance to additional knowledge.
